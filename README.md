## Project Status

This project is completed but can be improved by adding more features.

This needs improvement. Please check the following:

1. Dry: we can see that the code is not DRY. We can see that the same code is repeated multiple times. We can create a method and call it multiple times. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.

2. Naming: the variable names are not descriptive. We can use more descriptive names.

3. Indentation: the code is not properly indented. We can use the auto-indent feature of the IDE to fix this.

4. Comments: the code is not commented. We can add comments to make the code more readable.

5. Formatting: the code is not properly formatted. We can use the auto-format feature of the IDE to fix this.

6. Readme: the readme is not properly formatted. We can use markdown to format the readme.

7. Solid: the code is not SOLID. We can use the SOLID principles to make the code more maintainable.

8. Testing: the code is not tested. We can write unit tests to test the code.

9. Git: the git history is not clean. We can use the git history to understand the code. We can use the git history to revert to a previous version of the code. We can use the git history to see who made what changes to the code.

10. Commit messages: the commit messages are not descriptive. We can use descriptive commit messages to understand the code.
